              My journey to becoming a Financial Coach began in 2014. After decades apart, my childhood sweetheart and I got married.

              The only problem was, Bart had his way of handling finances, and I had mine. So, we agreed to find a ‚Äúthird way‚Äù to handle money and both follow it. We signed up for Financial Peace University (FPU) for the first time in 2015.

              We followed Dave Ramsey‚Äôs Baby Steps all the way to Step 7. It took us 34 months to get out of debt. We paid off just over $92,000 of debt (a credit card, a personal loan, and a student loan). We‚Äôve attended four FPU classes, and we‚Äôve led another three. We‚Äôve walked through the steps with family members and friends.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since 2017, I‚Äôve worked with people of all ages and circumstances to help them gain power over their finances. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I especially love helping people who want to ‚Äúgrow up and get this right‚Äù‚Äîno matter how old they are or what they‚Äôve done with money in the past. We all need second (or more) chances in life.

              Take Danny, for example. Danny used to check his account balance and transfer money on his phone in the checkout lane. He used to budget by seeing how much was left in the bank and divide that by how many days were left until payday.
            </p>
            <p>
              NOW, Danny says that no matter what kind of crazy is going on in his life, he can take a breath, look at his cash flow sheet, and experience a sense of well-being. He knows that, at the very least, all is well in the financial area of his life; he‚Äôs got that.
